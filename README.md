My first Freelance Project in the Winter of 2020.
Balancing Part-time work, full time studies, I made a custom website for a client with an Ostepathy clinic.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
